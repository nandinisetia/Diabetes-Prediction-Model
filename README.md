# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI. This project is done in Python. In this project, we use Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.
## Libraries Used are:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Sklearn
## Steps Involved are:
1. Data Collection and Analysis
2. Data Standardization
3. Train-Test Split
4. Training The Model
5. Model Evaluation
6. Making a Predictive System
